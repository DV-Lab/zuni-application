# ZUNI: A PLATFORM FOR PRIVACY PRESERVING ELECTRONIC CERTIFICATION
>> @flow-hackathon-season2

Hi superstars ✋, welcome to the ZUNI Application, developed by the DVLab team! 

ZUNI is a self-sovereign identity application focused on prioritizing information privacy. It enables users to take control of their identities while ensuring the safety and privacy of their sensitive information.

## Overview
In the current digital age, where information technology and communication are rapidly developing, centralized systems are proposed to improve the management of user data in any fields. However, all this data is stored on a centralized server and does not ensure the security of them. At the same time, the verification of information is only carried out by a few authorized personnel, leading to an unreliable or error-prone verification process. Instead, by applying blockchain technology, it is possible to create a secure and transparent system that allows organizations to issue, store, and verify information in a decentralized way. ZUNI addresses these challenges by combining decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) based on W3C specifications. With the power of zk-SNARKs, ZUNI can verify credentials without exposing personal data, enhancing privacy and data control for users.

## Repositories
The ZUNI consists of the following repositories:

1. Frontend: This repository contains the frontend code for the web application. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the application, managing DIDs, requesting VCs, and performing various operations related to identity verification.

2. Backend: The backend repository holds the server-side code for the system. It handles authentication, authorization, and the business logic required to manage DIDs, issue VCs, and perform verification operations.

3. Mobile: The mobile repository contains the code for the mobile application. It allows users to access their DIDs and VCs, providing a convenient and secure identity management solution for mobile devices.

4. Smart Contract: This repository includes the smart contract code for the ZUNI that deployed on the Flow Blockchain. The smart contract governs the issuance, revocation, and verification of VCs, ensuring their integrity and immutability.

5. ZK-Circuit: This zk-SNARK repository holds the code related to zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs) protocol integration within the ZUNI application. It enables efficient and accurate verification of proofs while preserving the privacy of holder information.

## Installation and Usage
